# Task Management System

A responsive, single-user task management web application built with Django. The app helps individuals plan projects, track tasks in a kanban board, monitor completion progress, and export data for reporting.

## Features

- Project dashboard with completion percentages and overdue task indicators
- Kanban-style project board with To Do, In Progress, and Done columns
- Task creation with descriptions, due dates, priorities, assignees, and comments
- Inline status updates for drag-and-drop style workflows
- CSV and JSON exports aligned with the provided specification
- Project archiving and restoration while keeping historical data accessible
- Admin interface for managing projects and tasks

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or later
- pip (or another PEP 517 compatible installer)
- (Optional) virtualenv, venv, or similar for isolated environments

## Local Development Setup

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\\Scripts\\activate`
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   You can install the Django dependency directly from the included `requirements.txt` or via the project-wide `pyproject.toml`.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # or
   pip install .
   ```

3. **Apply database migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Create an admin superuser (optional but useful for inspection):**

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
   ```

6. **Open the application:**

   Visit http://localhost:8000/ to access the dashboard.

## Deployment Notes

- The project ships with SQLite for simplicity. For production deployments replace the database configuration in `task_management_system/settings.py` with PostgreSQL or another managed database.
- Set `DEBUG = False` and provide a unique `SECRET_KEY` using environment variables before exposing the app publicly.
- Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to include your production domain(s).
- Collect static files for your hosting platform:

  ```bash
  python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
  ```

- When deploying on platforms like Docker or PaaS providers, ensure the `staticfiles` directory is served either by the platform or a web server (e.g., nginx).

## Running Tests

No automated tests are included yet. You can add Django tests under `projects/tests/` and run them with:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

## Export Formats

The export feature delivers task data either as CSV or JSON with the following columns:

| Column           | Description                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `project`        | Project name                                |
| `task_title`     | Task title                                   |
| `task_description` | Task description                            |
| `status`         | Human-readable task status                  |
| `priority`       | Human-readable task priority                |
| `assignee`       | Task assignee (if provided)                 |
| `due_date`       | ISO-8601 formatted due date (if provided)   |
