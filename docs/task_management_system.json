and rollback capabilities\n\n## User Stories\n\n### As a Project Manager\n\n**Story 1: Creating a New Project**\n- **Given** I need to start organizing a new initiative\n- **When** I click \"New Project\" and enter a name and description\n- **Then** I should see the project created and be able to start adding tasks immediately\n\n**Story 2: Managing Task Status**\n- **Given** I have tasks in different stages of completion\n- **When** I drag a task from \"In Progress\" to \"Done\"\n- **Then** The task status should update immediately with an undo option available\n\n**Story 3: Monitoring Project Progress**\n- **Given** I want to understand how my projects are progressing\n- **When** I view my project dashboard\n- **Then** I should see completion percentages and identify overdue tasks at a glance\n\n### As a Solo User\n\n**Story 4: Quick Task Creation**\n- **Given** I need to capture a new task quickly\n- **When** I click \"Add Task\" within a project and enter basic details\n- **Then** The task should be created in \"To Do\" status and be immediately editable\n\n**Story 5: Reorganizing Tasks**\n- **Given** I realize a task belongs in a different project\n- **When** I select the task and choose \"Move to Project\"\n- **Then** The task should transfer to the selected project while maintaining its properties\n\n**Story 6: Tracking Overdue Work**\n- **Given** Some of my tasks have passed their due dates\n- **When** I view my task lists\n- **Then** Overdue tasks should be clearly highlighted so I can prioritize them\n\n### As a Data-Conscious User\n\n**Story 7:
